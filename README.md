## Partial Support for Feedly using developer access token
* All articles from all the feeds the user subscribes to
* Option to show unread entries only or all entries
* Mark as read / mark as unread on chosen entry
* Auto mark as read on opened entry
* Choose which category to stream

Click [here](https://feedly.com/v3/auth/dev) to get Feedly developer access token.

*Please note that developer access token is only valid for a month and limited to just 250 API requests per day. After that you have to generate new access token.*
